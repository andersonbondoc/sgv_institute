In 2022, over 6.5 billion data records were exposed due to data breaches.</li> <li>Phishing: Phishing continues to be a significant threat in the banking industry. Cybercriminals use deceptive emails, text messages, or websites that appear legitimate to trick customers or employees into disclosing sensitive information such as account numbers, passwords, or personal details. Once they obtain this information, hackers can steal money, commit identity theft, or infiltrate the bank's internal systems</li> <li>Insider threats: Insider threats, whether from disgruntled employees, contractors, or third-party vendors, pose a significant risk to a bank's cybersecurity. Insiders with access to sensitive data can either intentionally or unintentionally leak information or create an entry point for hackers</li> <li>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks: These involve flooding a bank's online services with excessive traffic, leading to system slowdowns or crashes. This renders services such as online banking and payment processing unavailable. These attacks can be especially harmful to banks, disrupting business operations, frustrating customers, and leaving systems vulnerable to additional exploitation.</li> <li>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs): APTs are highly sophisticated attacks in which cybercriminals gain unauthorized access to a bank's network and meticulously monitor its systems. Over time, they steal data and compromise critical infrastructure. These attacks are particularly dangerous because they are difficult to detect and can remain unnoticed for months, allowing hackers to extract valuable information before the bank becomes aware of the breach.</li> <li>Third-party risk: Banks depend on third-party vendors and suppliers for various services, such as cloud storage and payment processing. Unfortunately, these third-party providers can be a weak link in a bank's cybersecurity chain. A cyberattack on a third-party vendor can create a backdoor, allowing hackers to access the bank's sensitive data.</li> <li>Compliance violations: Compliance violations can result in fines and other penalties. It is crucial to ensure that your organization and digitalization projects adhere to all applicable regulations.</li> </ul>",

Identifying potential issues, hazards, threats, and vulnerabilities that could negatively impact work efforts or plans forms the foundation of the risk management strategy. The project will employ several methods to identify risks:</p> <ul> <li>Examination  the work breakdown structure to identify potential risk areas.</li> <li>Conduct interviews with subject matter experts.</li> <li>Analyze lessons learned documents or engage in discussions.</li> <li>Examine design specifications for product enhancements, interfaces, and reports.</li> <li>Evaluate project management and implementation strategies.</li> <li>Perform risk assessment and risk management reviews.</li> </ul> <h3>Risk Assessment</h3> <p>Risk assessment involves analyzing identified risks and prioritizing them based on their potential threat to achieving project goals. During this phase, the project team examines each risk to determine its cause and potential effects. Risks are then rated based on their likelihood of occurrence and the severity of their impact on cost (e.g., Philippine Peso), schedule (e.g., time), and technical performance, as applicable.</p> <h4>Risk Handling</h4> <p>Risk handling involves identifying, evaluating, selecting, and implementing options to manage risks at acceptable levels, considering project constraints and objectives. This process outlines specific actions to be taken, timelines, responsible parties, and associated costs and schedules. The handling strategy is determined based on the overall risk assessment rating, as detailed below.</p> <h5>Risk Monitoring</h5> <p>Risk monitoring systematically tracks and evaluates the performance of risk-handling actions against established metrics throughout the project. It also involves developing additional risk-handling options as needed. To effectively control and manage risks during the project, the team regularly monitors both the risks and the outcomes of the risk-handling actions.</p><br/> <p>A Risk Register has been created to track each risk-handling activity for this project. Additionally, information on high overall risks will be included in the Monthly Project Status Report and discussed during Steering Committee meetings.</p>",

The project will employ several methods to identify risks:</p> <ul> <li>Examination  the work breakdown structure to identify potential risk areas.</li> <li>Conduct interviews with subject matter experts.</li> <li>Analyze lessons learned documents or engage in discussions.</li> <li>Examine design specifications for product enhancements, interfaces, and reports.</li> <li>Evaluate project management and implementation strategies.</li> <li>Perform risk assessment and risk management reviews.</li> </ul> <h3>Risk Assessment</h3> <p>Risk assessment involves analyzing identified risks and prioritizing them based on their potential threat to achieving project goals. During this phase, the project team examines each risk to determine its cause and potential effects. Risks are then rated based on their likelihood of occurrence and the severity of their impact on cost (e.g., Philippine Peso), schedule (e.g., time), and technical performance, as applicable.</p> <h4>Risk Handling</h4> <p>Risk handling involves identifying, evaluating, selecting, and implementing options to manage risks at acceptable levels, considering project constraints and objectives. This process outlines specific actions to be taken, timelines, responsible parties, and associated costs and schedules. The handling strategy is determined based on the overall risk assessment rating, as detailed below.</p> <h5>Risk Monitoring</h5> <p>Risk monitoring systematically tracks and evaluates the performance of risk-handling actions against established metrics throughout the project. It also involves developing additional risk-handling options as needed. To effectively control and manage risks during the project, the team regularly monitors both the risks and the outcomes of the risk-handling actions.</p><br/> <p>A Risk Register has been created to track each risk-handling activity for this project. Additionally, information on high overall risks will be included in the Monthly Project Status Report and discussed during Steering Committee meetings.</p> <h2>Avoid</h2> <p>Risk avoidance is a strategy in which the project team takes action to eliminate a threat or shield the project from its impact. This often involves modifying the Project Management plan to completely remove the threat.</p><br/> <p>The Project Manager may also isolate the project objectives from the risk's impact or alter the objective at risk. Examples include extending the schedule, changing the strategy, or reducing the scope. The most extreme avoidance strategy is to shut down the project entirely. Some risks that emerge early in the project can be avoided by clarifying requirements, gathering information, improving communication, or acquiring expertise</p> <h3>Mitigate</h3> <p>Risk mitigation is a strategy in which the project team takes action to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk. This involves lowering the probability and/or impact of an adverse risk to within acceptable threshold limits.</p><br/> <p>Taking early action to minimize the probability and/or impact of a risk occurring is often more effective than attempting to address the damage after the risk has materialized. Examples of mitigation actions include adopting less complex processes, conducting additional tests, or selecting a more reliable supplier.</p><br/> <p>Mitigation may also involve developing prototypes to reduce the risk of scaling up from a bench-scale model of a process or product. When it is not possible to reduce the probability, a mitigation response might focus on addressing the risk impact by targeting linkages that determine its severity. For instance, designing redundancy into a system can reduce the impact of a failure of the original component.</p> <h4>Transfer</h4> <p>Risk transfer is a strategy in which the project team shifts the impact of a threat to a third party, along with the responsibility for managing the response. Transferring the risk does not eliminate it; it simply assigns the responsibility for its management to another party. This does not mean disowning the risk by passing it to a later project or another person without their knowledge or agreement. Risk transfer typically involves paying a risk premium to the party assuming the risk.</p><br/> <p>Transferring liability for risk is particularly effective in managing financial risk exposure. Transfer tools can vary widely and include, but are not limited to, insurance, performance bonds, warranties, and guarantees. Contracts or agreements can be used to transfer liability for specific risks to another party. For example, if a buyer has capabilities that the seller lacks, it may be prudent to contractually transfer some work and its associated risk back to the buyer. In many cases, a cost-plus contract may transfer the cost risk to the buyer, while a fixed-price contract may transfer the risk to the seller.</p> <h5>Accept</h5> <p>Risk acceptance is a strategy in which the project team decides to acknowledge the risk and take no action unless the risk materializes. This approach is chosen when it is not feasible or cost-effective to address a specific risk in any other manner.</p><br/> <p>This strategy signifies that the project team has either decided not to alter the Project Management plan to address the risk or is unable to identify any other suitable response strategy. Risk acceptance can be either passive or active. Passive acceptance involves no action other than documenting the strategy, allowing the project team to address risks as they occur and periodically review the threat to ensure it does not change significantly. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, which includes allocating time, money, or resources to manage the risks.</p>"
