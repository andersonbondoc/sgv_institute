By adopting workflow software, managers gain a high-level overview of task delegation. Presented as a task map, this software illustrates who is responsible for each task, when tasks are due, and where they should be directed afterward. With this tool, teams can easily identify their responsibilities and know whom to report to, allowing them to spend more time on productive work and less on administrative tasks and paperwork.</p>"

Predictable and repetitive tasks are most suitable for process automation.</h4> <h5>Example No. 1 Self-service employee portal</h5> <ul> <li>A self-service employee portal allows users to log in and manage various administrative functions, such as making changes to their 401K investment options or selecting Human Resources (HR) benefits. Once these processes are automated, there is no need for an HR representative to oversee them, resulting in immediate data availability.

Predictable and repetitive tasks are most suitable for process automation.</h4> <h5>Example No. 3 Decision Making</h5> <ul> <li>Automation can greatly simplify decision-making processes that can be handled by machines, especially in the financial sector.

Additionally, the creation of visual artifacts aids groups in reaching consensus on design decisions.</p> <h4>Radical Collaboration</h4> <p>Design Thinking creates an environment where individuals from diverse disciplines can collaborate, embracing a wide range of thinking styles.
