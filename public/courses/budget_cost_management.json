Breaking down activity costs and expenses is a fundamental practice in project management and financial planning. It involves detailing and categorizing all the costs associated with each specific activity within a project. Here we have two examples of specific breakdowns of costs.</p> <p>Let’s dive into the planning and analysis. As an initial forecast, we can categorize this expense into two: market research and requirement analysis. Usually, an organization can choose if they will ‘outsource’ or make their mobile application in-house. Let’s say that the organization hired a vendor to collaborate with their own experts in the end-to-end process of creating a mobile application.</p> <p>As we see here, we followed the steps of the budget forecast in making the specific breakdown of the design and development expenses. From identifying activities, providing a description, calculating its monthly allocation, and computing its totals.</p>",
