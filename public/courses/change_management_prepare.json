However, internal resistance emerged as branch staff viewed agents as competitors, hindering the promotion of the digital channel. The limited scale of the pilot (50 agents) led to insufficient communication about the benefits of the agent network, resulting in misunderstandings among employees.</p> <p>To address this challenge, LAPO developed a change management strategy focused on enhancing communication and training to inform staff about the changes and their potential benefits, aiming to reduce resistance and maintain productivity during the agent network rollout.</p> <h4>Robust communication plan</h4> <p>The first step was to inform all staff via e-mail about the change management initiated and to open multiples channels of communication, including through videos and a dedicated e-mail address.</p> <h4>Addressing emotional aspects of change</h4> <p>The MD created a video to explain the changes and the impact of digitization, reassuring staff about job security. He shared his vision for LAPO, emphasized the urgency of supporting digital financial services, and used his leadership to gain internal support for the initiative.</p> <h4>Training Sessions</h4> <p>A change management plan was presented to LAPO's senior management, featuring training strategies for all 5,500 staff on digital channels. Regional facilitators conducted training sessions in Lagos and Benin City, which were then rolled out to branches. All employees received training, accompanied by evaluation forms to gather feedback and assess knowledge retention.</p> <h4>Constant feedback and adaptation</h4> <p>A dedicated change management email address facilitated employee feedback and reinforced messaging.
