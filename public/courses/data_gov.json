The goal is to ensure that data is accurately and securely transferred while maintaining its integrity and accessibility.</p> <h4>Data Archiving</h4> <p>Data archiving involves moving inactive or infrequently accessed data to a separate storage system designed for long-term retention. This process helps free up space in primary storage systems while ensuring that important historical data remains accessible for future reference, compliance, or analysis.</p> <h4>Data Deletion</h4> <p>Data deletion is the process of permanently removing data from a storage system, making it irretrievable. This can occur when data is no longer needed, when it reaches the end of its retention period, or in compliance with data privacy regulations. Proper data deletion practices ensure that sensitive information is securely destroyed to prevent unauthorized access or recovery.</p>",
