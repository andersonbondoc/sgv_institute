    "col1": "<h4>AI and Machine Learning in Fraud Detection</h4> <p>To achieve these improvements and keep up with the rapid pace of innovation, business leaders will require a flexible AI strategy. Banks will also need to continuously monitor the technology landscape, especially over the next two to three years, as developments advance in key areas:</p> <ul> <li><b>Small Language Models (SLMs)</b> -  An SLM is a machine-learning algorithm that has been trained on a dataset that is smaller and more specific than those of large language models (LLMs). SLMs are typically deployed for a single specific task (e.g. answering customers’ questions about a particular product); they can be more efficient and faster than LLMs due to their size and their use of a more targeted dataset.</li> <li><b>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</b> - RAG is a process that enhances the capability of genAI models by optimizing LLMs – increasing both accuracy and reliability. This process uses in-house data repositories (e.g. internal organizational data such as policy or procedural documents) to support the validation of responses to ensure it is combing the latest and most accurate responses. Companies can incorporate RAG into their AI-based assistants, making them more effective and reliable at answering customer questions, by validating responses against a master repository (such as knowledge articles in a repository).</li> </ul>", 
    "col2": "<ul><li><b>AI Agents</b> - These are designed and built to understand inputs, make decisions and act on them without any human intervention. When AI acts as an agent instead of a service, it is no longer locked into assisting with a single task or function, but can be applied to a broader range of problems and decision-making opportunities. An example of this is the use of AI agents that can process enquiries, action customer requests and make product recommendations.</li> <li><b>Quantum Computing </b> - By integrating quantum computers with conventional supercomputers, parts of traditional problem-solving workflows can be accelerated. Leveraging quantum computing in AI models would allow faster processing of larger datasets and accelerated decision-making, especially in areas requiring complex pattern recognition. An example of this would be quicker identification of fraudulent transactions for banks and payment processors.</li> </ul>"

In this regard, BSFIs should be guided by the definition of PEPs in the regulations to identify and assess whether the prospective customer qualifies as a PEP, including  the determination of past and present PEPs. BSFIs should refrain from the wholesale concept of  “Once a PEP, always a PEP” as this is not consistent with the risk-based approach. BSFIs are advised to use risk-based assessment to determine whether there are any residual risks or significant influences posed by the customer or past PEP. Relevant factors can be considered in declassifying a former PEP, such as the position held and its susceptibility to corruption or misappropriation of state funds or assets, length of time in office and the likelihood of return to office in the future, the level of transparency about the source of wealth and origin of funds, in  particular, those funds generated as a consequence of office held, and how politically connected they remain once they have left office, among others.</p> <p>To facilitate the identification of PEPs, BSFIs shall adopt its database on PEPs which shall be regularly updated.
