Establish customer success as a company-wide goal and priority</h6> <p>Whether or not you have a specific customer success team, it’s vital to highlight the importance of helping customers achieve success across the entire organization. A key strategy for ensuring that customer success remains a priority is to educate your company on its purpose and value. Different teams may have varying interpretations of data, so it’s essential to tailor your communication to align with the language and perspective of the team you are addressing.</p> <h6>2. Recognize how your customers define success</h6> <p>Your company should strive to cultivate success based on the customer's perspective rather than on your own assumptions or expectations. To effectively grasp what success means to your customers, it is crucial to stay attuned to their feedback and analyze their behavior within the product.</p>",
      "col2": "<h6>3. Prepare customers for success through proactive onboarding:</h6> <p>Customer success initiatives commence the moment a person becomes a customer. By implementing proactive onboarding, you can help new customers get off to a strong start. This includes tailoring the product to fit their requirements, instructing them on how to use the essential features, and aiding them in becoming comfortable with the product as a whole.</p> <h6>4. Monitor vital customer metrics and disseminate data across teams</h6> <p>Successfully prioritizing and supporting customer success involves tracking relevant customer metrics and sharing that information among teams. Here are several important customer success metrics to keep an eye on:</p> <ul> <li>Customer lifetime value</li> <li>Repeat purchase rate</li> <li>Customer retention rate</li> <li>Customer retention cost</li> <li>Churn rate</li> <li>Customer health score</li> <li>Net promoter score</li> <li>Customer satisfaction score</li> <li>Customer effort score</li> </ul> <h6>5. Create a customer feedback loop</h6> <p>Regularly seeking feedback and keeping communication channels open encourages customers to share their concerns if something goes wrong or if they begin to feel unhappy. You should always be refining and adjusting your strategy based on the insights and feedback from customers. Establishing a loop that continuously collects genuine customer feedback is the best approach to stay responsive to changes and ensure long-term proactivity.</p>"

      "col1": "<h4>Customer Success Lifecycle</h4> <img src='/src/assets/img/digital_customer_onboarding/application_approval/order32.jpg'> <p>The Customer Success lifecycle acts as an internal playbook by mapping out the important touch points to help your customers grow from brand-new users to loyal ambassadors of your product. Though each company’s Customer Success lifecycle will vary slightly depending on what they offer, the stages outlined below act as a guide to helping your team empathize with your customers and capitalizing on areas of improvement.</p> <h5>Onboarding</h5> <p>Onboarding is the first step in getting new customers effectively set up with your product or service. This phase is vital as it sets the tone for the entire customer relationship. The primary aim of onboarding is to ensure that new customers have a smooth and successful initial experience. Typically, you will have a checklist of tasks that customers must complete to be considered fully onboarded. This could be as straightforward as creating a login and gaining access, or it might involve a lengthy implementation process that includes data integrations, project planning, and coordination with numerous stakeholders. Regardless of whether you conduct the onboarding yourself, collaborate with a specialized team, or provide customers with the resources to onboard independently, it’s essential to track the time it takes. The duration of the onboarding process is an important KPI to monitor and strive to reduce, as any time spent onboarding is time that the customer is not utilizing your product.</p> <h5>Education</h5> <p>It should be noted that education and training are essential throughout the entire customer lifecycle, but they are especially vital right after onboarding when customers are using your product independently for the first time. Even if your onboarding checklist indicates that you have covered the key features, there is a good chance that customers may have missed some (or all) of that information amid the implementation process. Education can take various forms, and a one-size-fits-all approach does not apply. It could include a how-to manual, an online resource center, short instructional videos available within the product, on-demand videos, or comprehensive instructor-led training sessions. Regardless of the format, it is essential to make these resources accessible to your customers and ensure they are regularly updated to reflect any changes made by the product team. Customers who receive training show engagement rates that are twice as high as those who attempt to navigate the product on their own, making this investment worthwhile.</p>",
      "col2": "<h5>Adoption</h5> <p>Adoption is the phase where the focus shifts to encouraging customers to actively engage with and explore the full capabilities of your product or service. By the time customers enter the adoption phase, the onboarding process has been completed, the product is operational, and new users have at least a fundamental understanding of how to use your product to meet their objectives. At this point, users will begin to integrate the product into their daily workflows and start to recognize the value it provides. This is also the time to begin monitoring usage patterns to make timely adjustments as customers acclimate. How frequently and in what ways are they utilizing the product? Are they submitting numerous support tickets? Are your customer success managers (CSMs) receiving many inquiries? Do they require additional training? This is a crucial period to ensure that your customers are fully prepared to succeed.</p> <h5>Value Realization</h5> <p>The value realization phase occurs when your product exceeds the expectations of the end user, resulting in a positive return on investment (ROI). When a customer reaches this phase, it indicates that they have integrated the product into their daily workflow, utilizing a wide range of features that meet or surpass their expectations regarding how your product can assist them. At this stage, the customer is most open to cross-selling and upselling opportunities. They are convinced that the value your product provides justifies the money they spent, leading them to believe that your other offerings are equally worthwhile. Your marketing efforts aimed at the existing customer base should take advantage on this newfound confidence.</p> <h5>Expansion</h5> <p>This phase is centered on motivating customers to increase their usage or upgrade their plans in order to maximize the value they receive from your product or service. The main goal of the expansion phase is to boost customer lifetime value. Harness the enthusiasm of your top customers by seeking out reviews, testimonials, case studies, and even offering incentives for referral programs. Recent market research indicates that the influence of word-of-mouth marketing is increasing — prospective customers place greater value on the opinions of existing customers than on your own marketing efforts. By keeping your current customers are happy and successful, they will become your most valuable source of new customers, initiating a positive cycle.</p>"
